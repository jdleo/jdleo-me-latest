Hey, this is the source code for my personal website, [jdleo.me](https://jdleo.me)

It's intentionally minimal, and I'm just using Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, and Vercel.
I don't want a complicated website, I just want something I don't have to update so often, lol.

If you want to use this code or take inspiration, just fork, develop, run `npm run dev`, push to a gh repo, and link to vercel. That's it.
